## 5 things to check when select a no-code website builder

Hey no-code newbie fellows! Allow me to save you some time :D
Do not begin building with a no-code tool unless you have first checked:


## 1. Database storage
**Where will your datas be stored?**

> Google Sheet, Airtable, or built-in database : popular options for no-code database storage

The Airtable pro plan is free for the first 14 days, after which your amount of records per base is drastically reduced (no hard-feeling, I love Airtable).

Also, check the limitations of your tool's database if it has one (often be 1GB, 2GB, 5GB)

Back up your valuable data in other ways as well to ensure that you do not lose it (scary :confounded:)


## 2. Custom domain
**How much to map a custom domain?**
Most of the tool will charge fee if you want to map your custom domain.
Some tool you can manage to do it for free (with a badget, or maybe take times to set up for free)
Anyway, check if it

## 3. Final UI
**How final UI will look like?**
Each no-code tool has a certain way of style of the finishing UI. Hence better check if the style are not as clean or as modern as you want.
You can easily verify this by visiting their template library or searching for a tutorial on YouTube (also my best tips to check UI quick for any products)

## 4. SEO support
**Will the tool include basic to advance SEO support?**
Some no-code tools are built with a prototype/minimum viable product in mind, and the SEO aspect may be left off the feature list (:cry:)
So, if you want users to be able to find your page by search engine, double-check now rather than later.

## 5. Support your language 
**Will the typography broken on UI in my language?**
This maybe is odd, but I faced the fact that Vietnamese require special stress marks (ă â ờ ô ổ..) and not every page support Vietnamese compatible fonts.
So, maybe worth check it on your languages as well.
