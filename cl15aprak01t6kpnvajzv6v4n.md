## Hey, only 0.5% population know how to code

And I am not belong to that 0.5%.

*(doesn't count my struggling-functioning Python crawling scripts, my fail efforts to learn Numpy and dip a toe to DS, my hardware programming days with C++, Assembly (Ouch), my months long learn Matlab, my copy and paste snipper code MySQL, my download and deploy HTML/CSS/JS packages,.. the list goes on but there is nothing fun to tell you about T..T)

Technology changes every two weeks (ouch), and it affects everything. And you - you can catch up and create meaningful new things whenever you want.

So maybe on a platform like Hashnode.dev, where everyone around you is a fantastic, top-of-the-line developer.
I'd like to remind you,

> ### You are talented, you have the a skill set that companies are willing to pay extra for.
> ### Moreover, you are extremely **brave**!

So, my friends, as a Product Manager who may have to play it cool from time to time in order to keep the project moving forward.
I'd like to say deep down how much I admire you.

> Not everyone can become a developer

Also, thank you for your efforts to explain complicated technology to me on a daily basis (hehe)!
